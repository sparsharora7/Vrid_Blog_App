The Blog App is an Android application designed to display a list of blog posts fetched from an online source and allow users to read them directly within the app.
It features a clean and responsive interface built using Jetpack Compose, Google’s modern UI toolkit for Android development.
When the app starts, it uses Retrofit, a widely used networking library, to connect to a REST API and retrieve blog post data. 
The blog titles are shown in a scrollable list. When a user taps on a blog post, the app navigates to a new screen that opens the full post in a WebView, allowing the user to read the article without leaving the app.
The app is built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which separates the UI, business logic, and data handling. 
The ViewModel manages the app’s state, including loading and error handling, using StateFlow.
This ensures a smooth user experience by displaying loading indicators when data is being fetched and showing meaningful error messages when needed.
In summary, the Blog App is a simple yet complete example of a modern Android application that demonstrates how to combine Jetpack Compose, Retrofit, ViewModel, and WebView to deliver a functional and clean user experience.
